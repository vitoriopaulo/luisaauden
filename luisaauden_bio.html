Luisa Auden is an American Jewelry Designer, born in May 2nd 2015 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Very earlier in her childhood, it was clear her passion and incredible talent to the Visual Arts as a whole. Differently from the absolutely majority of her friends from high school, she decided  not go to college. Instead, Luisa Auden built her path in the Jewelry Design field in a very unique style: conducting independent research, traveling world-wide in order to learn about her industry from different cultures, as well as working as a sole-practitioner. 

</p> 

<p> 

Her very unique, personal, creative, irreverent, forward-thinking, out-of-the-box approach and understanding of Art and Design, resulted in a very first Jewelry collection that totally disrupted the Status-Quo. In her earlier 20's, Luisa Auden won the majority of the most important Jewelry Design Awards not only in The United States, but World Wide. Replicas of her first creation, which made her become a Star of the Design of her generation, entitled - Sacred Hearts' Ruby: a necklace of her authorship designed in a shape of two hearts (one smaller, other bigger - both mixed togheter) - a tribute to her father Vitorio Paulo, a Brazilian Architect and an United States of America Immigrant - became a permanent patrimony of the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston (MFA), Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) New York city and the Louvre Museum in Paris, France.

<p> 

Currently in her earlier 30's Luisa Auden, after more then a decade of practice in the Jewelry Design industry, lives and works peacefully in Cambridge, MA, United States of America, manage the sales of her products in her online Design Store which brands her name, travels world 
wide participating in Design Exhibitions and Lecturing.
