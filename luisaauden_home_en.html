Luisa Auden is an American Jewelry Designer, born in May 2nd 2015 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Very earlier in her childhood, it was clear her passion and incredible talent to the Visual Arts as a whole. Differently from the absolutely majority of her friends from highschool, she decided to not go to gollege. Instead, Luisa Auden built her path in the Jewelry Design industry in a very unique style: conducting independent research, traveling world-wide in order to learn from different cultures, as well as working as a sole-practitioner.

Her very unique, personal, criative, irreverent, out-of-the-box approach and understanding of Art and Design, resulted in a first Jewelry collection that totally disrupted the Status-Quo.
